 - Summary of meeting
    - Initial meeting was not exactly meant to be a team meeting as our meeting was set for 2022-11-17 at 18:30 - 19:00. This was initially just for Tan to teach me (Joao) how to understand HTML, CSS, and bootstrap. From there we found that everyone was online so we eventually turned it into a meeting. With that, we started talking about what we have accomplished so far. Currently, we have gone over the 12 functional requirements and what we have to do within the next week. Alongside this, we also are coming up with 4 non-functional requirements as we progress throughout the week. We also have passed the design stage in which we know how we want our website to look and where the functions are going to be located. From here we moved on to what each of us is going to be doing with this project and dividing up the work in the future. Currently, we are just setting up everything regarding the front end and once we have all that set up we will implement the functionalities. Overall we have found ourselves with a good pace and are set to finish before Wednesday.

 - Summary of meeting
    - For this meeting we found ourselves having a hard time recalling what we did the last week and a half. Due to the break and our position with our website we found ourselves voting on just resting over break. Now during this meeting we looked over the milestone 2 requirements and the deadline presented to us. To make sure we reached the deadline in time we decided to deligate our tasks between each other (peer programming). With this we ended up splitting Joao and Romuz working on the "chirps" or the messages to the users while Choyee and Tan worked on getting the users to be able to follow each other. With this we found ourselves on track to complete the task at hand before the deadline and also have time to work on making the website better for the user. Looking more towards the future we tried to also discuss time management as finals are coming up and we don't want this project to interfere with our other studies. With this we made a self deadline to finish some what before finals week came around. Overall we have completed the Login, logout, create account, delete account, authentication, and external api requirements. The home page and user profile are almost done. The posting and followers are being worked on.
